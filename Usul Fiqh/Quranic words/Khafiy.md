## Definition
It seems apparent, but due to an external reason, there is an ambiguity that has been established.

## Example
The ayah of the one who commits a robbery, hands are to be removed. 

However, there are different types of robbery you can do, and the Arabic language has different ways to describe them. Such as a coffin robber. Or a pickpocket. So does the ayah in question include them?

The classical opinion is that yes, but some scholars make a differentiation on whether the item in question is outside and/or protected.
