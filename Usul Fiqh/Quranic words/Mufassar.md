## Definition 
Explained

When something is dhahir, but the speaker gives a further elaboration on what he said.

## Example
The angels prostrated, all of them together.

The second statement uses the word "kulluhum". There is no room for any angel to be missed out. Without the elaboration, someone could cast doubt on whether it was all angels or not.

## Difference between nass and mufassar
In [Nass](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Nass.md), an external explanation was required, in mufassar, the speaker himself has elaborated, so it is a step more accurate in its true meaning.

A mufassar statement is dhahir and nass as well.
