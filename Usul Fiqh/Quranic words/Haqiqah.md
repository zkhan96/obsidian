title: "Haqiqah"
enableToc: true
---
Definition: a word being used in the meaning it was derived for
Example: 
A person swears by Allah that they will not eat from this tree.

You could take the haqiqah (literal meaning) from it. There are 4 scenarios:
1. Haqiqah muta’addhirah: it is near impossible to achieve it
2. Haqiqah mahjoorah: it is near impossible due to societal norms (‘urfan) and shari’ah
3. Haqiqah musta’malah: where urfan and shar’an it is accepted and practiced, and it is wajib to do aml upon it 
4. Haqiqah qaasirah: it is allowed in the shariah potentially, but societal norm will dictate whether it is possible or not

Another example: 

A man swears by Allah that he will not buy a head, urfan this means cow, goat, sheep head. 
If someone was to bring a chicken head, or a fish head, this would contradict societal norms. 

Between haqiqah and majaz there is [Umoomu Majaz](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Umoomu%20Majaz.md)
