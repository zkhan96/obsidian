Here is a diagram of Haqiqah:
![Haqiqah diagram](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Haqiqah%20diagram.png)
## Example: 
- A person swears by Allah that they will not eat from this tree.

You could take the haqiqah (literal meaning) from it. There are 4 scenarios:
1. Haqiqah muta'addhirah: it is near impossible to achieve it
2. Haqiqah mahjoorah: it is near impossible due to societal norms (urfan) and shari’ah
3. Haqiqah musta'malah: where urfan and shar’an it is accepted and practiced, and it is wajib to do aml upon it 
4. Haqiqah qaasirah: it is allowed in the shariah potentially, but societal norm will dictate whether it is possible or not

## Example 2: 
- A man swears by Allah that he will not buy a head, [Urfan](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Urfan.md) this means cow, goat, sheep head. 
- If someone was to bring a chicken head, or a fish head, this would contradict societal norms. 

Between haqiqah and majaz there is [Umoomu Majaz](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Umoomu%20Majaz.md)
