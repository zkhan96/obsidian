## Is the amr limited?
There are two types of amr:
1. Mutlaq (unlimited) bil waqt: you just have to do it once in your lifetime e.g. Hajj
2. Muqayyid (limited) bil waqt: it has to be done within a specific timeframe e.g. Salaah

### Can amr be limited to time and place? 
Yes, for example, Hajj. Or for a sacrifice for a major mistake done during hajj, must only be done within the haram.
