It has to be bitareeqil isti'laa.

Someone with high authority dictates or commands those of lower authority.

The general usul in hanafi fiqh is al amru lilwujoob, a commandment is to be compulsory.

A commandment can come in different types. We're going to cover a few examples below.

![Repeating](Usul%20Fiqh/Commandments/Repeating.md)

![Highlighting Permissibility](Usul%20Fiqh/Highlighting%20Permissibility.md)

## To Honour
Sometimes an amr is an ikraam (to give value).

### Example
The ayah of entering paradise with peace and complete satisfaction. 
[Hijr:46](https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=46)

This gives value and respect to the believer for being successful in the hereafter. 

### To Ridicule
Sometimes an amr is an ihaanah (to ridicule or belittle someone)

### Example
The ayah saying taste what you have earned, because you are honoured and respected.
[Ad-dukhan:49](https://quran.com/44?startingVerse=49)

This is a sarcastic ridicule as this is being said to the dwellers of hellfire.

## Implied Commandment
Sometimes within the amr there is a hukm present and sometimes there is an external factor. 

There is hasan lighayrihi, and hasan lidhaatihi

### Example
Within wudhoo, and he broke wudhoo, at face value, you are not cleaning anything, and at face value there is negativity around it, but it is still a beautiful act because it is a commandment of Allah and it is now the spiritual aspect that you are aiming to achieve.

## Is the amr limited?
There are two types of amr:
1. Mutlaq (unlimited) bil waqt: you just have to do it once in your lifetime e.g. Hajj
2. Muqayyid (limited) bil waqt: it has to be done within a specific timeframe e.g. Salaah

### Can amr be limited to time and place? 
Yes, for example, Hajj. Or for a sacrifice for a major mistake done during hajj, must only be done within the haram.
