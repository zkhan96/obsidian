It has to be bitareeqil isti'laa.

Someone with high authority dictates or commands those of lower authority.

The general usul in hanafi fiqh is al amru lilwujoob, a commandment is to be compulsory.

A commandment can come in different types. We're going to cover a few examples below.

## Repeating
When a commandment is given, is there repetition or not? Does the action need to be repeated more than once and continuously? The type of evidence will dictate whether there is repetition or not.

### Example
Sacrificing an animal during the days of tashreek

## Recommendation 
Sometimes an amr is an irshad (a recommendation).

### Example
The ayah of whenever you establish a contract, you should have witnesses.
[Baqarah:282](https://quran.com/2?startingVerse=282)

## Highlighting Permissibility
Sometimes an amr is an ibaahah, i.e. is it highlighting its permissibility.

### Example
The ayah of a dog being trained to catch a prey and not kill it, then it is permitted to eat from it
[Maidah:4](https://quran.com/5?startingVerse=4)

## To Honour
Sometimes an amr is an ikraam (to give value).

### Example
The ayah of entering paradise with peace and complete satisfaction. 
[Hijr:46](https://quran.com/15?startingVerse=46)

This gives value and respect to the believer for being successful in the hereafter. 

### To Ridicule
Sometimes an amr is an ihaanah (to ridicule or belittle someone)

### Example
The ayah saying taste what you have earned, because you are honoured and respected.
[Ad-dukhan:49](https://quran.com/44?startingVerse=49)

This is a sarcastic ridicule as this is being said to the dwellers of hellfire.

## Implied Commandment
Sometimes within the amr there is a hukm present and sometimes there is an external factor. 

There is hasan lighayrihi, and hasan lidhaatihi

### Example
Within wudhoo, and he broke wudhoo, at face value, you are not cleaning anything, and at face value there is negativity around it, but it is still a beautiful act because it is a commandment of Allah and it is now the spiritual aspect that you are aiming to achieve.

## Is the amr limited?
There are two types of amr:
1. Mutlaq (unlimited) bil waqt: you just have to do it once in your lifetime e.g. Hajj
2. Muqayyid (limited) bil waqt: it has to be done within a specific timeframe e.g. Salaah

### Can amr be limited to time and place? 
Yes, for example, Hajj. Or for a sacrifice for a major mistake done during hajj, must only be done within the haram.
