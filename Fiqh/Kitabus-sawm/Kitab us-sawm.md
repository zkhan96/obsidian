The coming of the second twilight is when fajr begins and the time for fasting begins. In high latitude locatinons, there are 4 ways to calculate fajr:
1. Aqranul ayyam: the last day you saw the time of fajr
2. Nisful layl: you split the night into two parts, first is isha, second is fajr
3. Subhul layl: you distribute the night into 7 parts and the last part is fajr 
4. Aqrabul bilaad: the closest city that has a proper fajr and isha

The one who breaks the fast forgetfully it is like Allah has nourished him
