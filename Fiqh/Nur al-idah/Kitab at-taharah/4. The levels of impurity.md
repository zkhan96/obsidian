In islamic jurisprudence, Najasah mughaladhah and Najasah mukhaffafah refer to different levels of impurity, which need to be cleansed from a person, clothing, or place for purification.
## Najasah mughaladha
This is considered a severe impurity, and it requires a more stringent process of cleansing. 
Types of major impurities:
- saliva of dogs
- pig-related products
or substances explicitly identified as significantly impure.

Cleansing such impurities sometimes involves multiple washings, sometimes with water and sometimes with soil.

If on the clothes there is the size of a dirham's worth of this type of impurity or less, then it is permissible to pray in it with dislike.
## Najasah Mukhaffafah
This is a lighter form of impurity, and the process of cleaning it is simpler. 
Types of minor impurities involve the urine of a baby that has not started eating solid food yet. 

Cleansing such impurities can be as simple as sprinkling water over the affected area without needing extensive washing.

If on the clothes there is under a quarter of it covered in this type of impurity, then it is permissible to pray in it with dislike.
